# Introduction

Pet project to develop creative / unconventional software for financial/time series modeling and prediction 
on the cloud. The numerical methods described in the features section is more in line with the practical
implementation of the following ideas. Essentially any problem or discipline which has 
repeating patterns is fair game. The following list is the result of stream-of-consciousness brainstorming. I have absolutely no
idea if any of these will work, but the general philosophy is to use heterogeneous media which (I am hoping) are 
not used in current modelings. Clearly, before implementing or exploring ANY of these ideas, I need to figure out
what I even want to model or predict, which will take time as I have no finance experience whatsoever. 

	1. Seismic activity
	2. Musical composition 
	3. Quantum mechanics, path integrals, etc. (If I had to guess, this is already being worked on)
	4. Cosmological body detection? I.e. dealing with signals with lots of noise. 
	5. Topological defects / meta materials / crystallography
	6. Persistent homology
	7. Networks/graphs
	8. Spatiotemporal formulation of dynamical systems theory (i.e. my Ph.D. work)

# Features

The features included in this package are in order for me to gain hands-on experience, not
necessarily techniques well suited for any subject or discipline. Some of these I already have
some experience, but each discipline has incredible depth. 

	1. Stochastic PDEs
	2. Bayesian inference / modeling
	3. Neural nets 
	4. Numerical optimization
	5. Cloud computing via AWS. 

# Objective

While the primary objective is to learn the various techniques and tools, the end point
for this project would likely be adoption by others or selling the techniques to some institution.
I have no preference towards which this is, but I like the idea of others valuing my work. 
There is no telling how long this endeavor could be. It could be a life long journey; I really have
no idea.
